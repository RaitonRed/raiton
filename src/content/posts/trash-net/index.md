# ♻️ TrashNet: Smart Waste Classification with Deep Learning

Have you ever wondered if a machine could recognize waste types just by looking at them?  
Well... I built one! 💡

## 🧠 What is TrashNet?

**TrashNet** is a deep learning-based image classification system that can automatically identify different types of waste, such as:

- 🧻 Paper  
- 🥤 Plastic  
- 🪞 Glass  
- 🥫 Metal  
- 📦 Cardboard  
- 🚮 General Trash

It uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** powered by **TensorFlow** and trained on a labeled image dataset to classify waste into the correct category.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- `Python 3`
- `TensorFlow / Keras`
- `OpenCV`
- `Scikit-learn`
- `NumPy & Matplotlib`
- `Jupyter Notebook`

---

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset is organized into folders for each waste class and contains hundreds of labeled images.  
All images are resized to `128x128` pixels and normalized for training.
