Last night, I was playing Minecraft. Alone.  
I created a new map — in Creative mode. Just for fun.  
Then a message popped up in the chat:

> **"Why did you come back?"**

But I was the only one there.  
Checked the console. Only one player: **me**.

I started building a house — even made a pixel art of Deadpool.  
When I came back later, I saw something written on the wall in red blocks:

> **DON’T BUILD HIM AGAIN**

I didn’t panic. I restarted.  
This time, it started at night. No moon. The sounds were... off.  
It felt like someone was whispering into my ear:

> **"You’re just like the others... who never came back."**

I closed the game.  
But the whispers didn’t stop.  
It’s 3:40 a.m. now. My laptop is shut.  

But a message just appeared on the screen:

> **"World saved."**
