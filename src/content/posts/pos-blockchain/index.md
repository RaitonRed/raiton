In this post, I'll walk through the architecture and key components of a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain I've been developing. This project implements a full blockchain node with smart contract capabilities, wallet management, and peer-to-peer networking.

## Core Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with these main components:

1. **Consensus Layer**: Proof-of-Stake with validator selection
2. **Networking Layer**: P2P communication between nodes
3. **Execution Layer**: Smart contract virtual machine
4. **Data Layer**: Blockchain storage and state management
5. **Interface Layer**: CLI and REST API

```python
class BlockchainNode:
    def __init__(self, host, p2p_port, api_port):
        self.blockchain = Blockchain()
        self.mempool = Mempool()
        self.wallet = Wallet(self)
        self.p2p_network = P2PNetwork(host, p2p_port, self.blockchain)

```

## Key Innovations

### 1. Hybrid Validator Selection

The system uses a combination of stake-weighted selection and Verifiable Random Functions (VRF) for fair validator rotation:

```python
class ProofOfStake:
    def select_validator(self, seed):
        total_stake = sum(self.validators.values())
        vrf = VRF(private_key=self.staking_contract)
        proof = vrf.prove(seed)
        random_value = int.from_bytes(proof, 'big') % total_stake
        # Stake-weighted selection...
```

### 2. Secure Wallet Management

- The wallet system implements:
- Hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets
- PBKDF2 key derivation
- Encrypted private key storage
- Multi-account support

```python
class Wallet:
    def _drive_encryption_key(self):
        kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
            algorithm=hashes.SHA512(),
            length=32,
            salt=salt,
            iterations=100000,
            backend=default_backend()
        )
        return base64.urlsafe_b64encode(kdf.derive(password.encode()))
```

### 3. Optimized Smart Contract Execution

The VM features:

- Gas metering
- Memory limits
- Timeout protection
- Storage management

```python
class SmartContractVM:
    GAS_COSTS = {
        'ADD': 3,
        'SUB': 3,
        'MUL': 5,
        'SSTORE': 200,
        # ... other opcodes
    }
    
    def execute(self, tx, block_number, timestamp):
        signal.alarm(5)  # 5-second timeout
        try:
            # Execute contract code
            # ...
        finally:
            signal.alarm(0)
```

## Performance Optimization

1. Block Cache: LRU caching of recent blocks
2. Batch Processing: Bulk transaction saving
3. Compact Blocks: Reduced bandwidth usage
4. State Pruning: Periodic state cleanup

```python
class Blockchain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.block_cache = LRUCache(capacity=100)
        
    def add_block(self, block):
        self.block_cache.put(block.index, block)
        # ...
```

## Networking Protocol

The P2P layer implements:

- Message signing/verification
- Compact block propagation
- Transaction gossiping
- Peer discovery

```python
class P2PNetwork:
    def broadcast_block(self, block):
        if len(block.transactions) > 10:
            self.broadcast_message({
                "type": "compact_block",
                "data": block.to_compact()
            })
        else:
            # Full block broadcast
```

## Lessons Learned

1. State Management is Hard: Tracking balances, nonces, and contract storage requires careful synchronization.
2. Security Tradeoffs: Every convenience feature (like auto-loading wallets) creates potential attack vectors.
3. Testing is Crucial: Blockchain systems need extensive test coverage due to their irreversible nature.
4. Document Early: Complex interactions between components become unmanageable without good documentation.

## Future Work

1. Sharding support
2. Cross-chain interoperability
3. Zero-knowledge proofs
4. Formal verification of smart contracts
