# About

Hey, I'm Raiton — a curious mind behind this blog.

I'm a teenage content creator, developer, and experimenter who loves exploring everything from Minecraft builds to artificial intelligence. I build, I break, I learn — and I share that journey here.

You'll find all sorts of stuff on this blog: thoughts, code snippets, project updates, personal reflections, tech rants, and maybe even some anime vibes.

I’m passionate about making cool things and telling stories around them. Whether it’s coding a self-flying AI drone or sharing behind-the-scenes from my YouTube videos, I try to keep it real, raw, and a little bit chaotic — just like life.

This blog isn’t just about what I do, it’s about how I think.  
Welcome to my digital notebook.
